### Short Desciption about the event:

Treasure hunts are information-based scavenger hunts, or puzzle hunts, in which teams use their collective brainpower to solve clues. Each team is presented with a group of algorithmic problems or mathematical clues which teams must solve in order to find a piece of information to get final solution at the end of hunt.

### Rules and Regulations :

- There should be 3-4 members in a group. Group having more than 4 members will be disqualified.
- If any of the group is found teaming up with some other group to complete a given task, groups involved in it will be disqualified.
- Each team must at-least have one android device. (Youâ€™ll need it for some rounds).
- The hunting is divided in 5 rounds.
- Qualified groups will have to proceed to next round.
- Algorithms will be explained by the coordinators.
- Misbehaving with any coordinators or volunteers will lead to direct disqualification.
- All decisions will be taken by higher authority.
